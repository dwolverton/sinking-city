# Sinking City
A clone of the Forbidden Island board game that I build when learning Angular. It uses Angular 9.

See it live here: [sinking-city.surge.sh](https://sinking-city.surge.sh).

There is a client and server in the source code, but I think I stopped working on this project before I really got the server part built out.
